/**
 * @defgroup nvodm_discovery ODM Peripheral Discovery Interface
 *
 * This is the ODM query interface allowing ODMs to specify the connectivity
 * of peripherals on their boards to I/Os on an NVIDIA&reg; Application Processor
 * without modifying the driver libraries.
 *
 * All peripherals connected to the application processor are referenced by
 * their Global Unique Identifier code, or GUID. The GUID is an ODM-defined
 * 64-bit value (8-character code) that uniquely identifies each peripheral,
 * i.e., each peripheral will have exactly one GUID, and each GUID will refer
 * to exactly one peripheral.
 * 
 * The implementation of this API is similar to a simple database: tables are
 * provided by the ODMs that, for every peripheral, define the peripheral's
 * GUID, and specify the bus, or set of buses, to which the peripheral is
 * connected. As an example, an audio codec peripheral with GUID 0 could be
 * connected to the application processor by DAP instance 0, I2C instance 1
 * (address 0x80), and voltage rail 3. The functions provided by this API
 * provide facilities enabling the boot process and driver libraries to
 * enumerate the set of peripherals attached to a specific bus, the set of
 * peripherals with specific functionality (such as display outputs), and the
 * set of buses connected to a specific peripheral.
