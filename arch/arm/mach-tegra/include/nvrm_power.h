/**
 * Request frequency increase for SOC-wide clock to avoid real-time starvation
 * conditions. Allows modules to contribute to the detection and avoidance of
 * clock starvation for DFS controlled clocks.
 * 
 * This API should be called to indicate starvation threat and also to cancel
 * request when a starvation condition has eased.
 * 
 * @note Although the RM DFS does its best to manage clocks without starving
 * the system for clock cycles, bursty clock usage can occasionally cause
 * short-term clock starvation. One solution is to leave a large enough clock
 * rate guard band such that any possible burst in clock usage will be absorbed.
 * This approach tends to waste clock cycles, and worsen power management.
 * 
 * By allowing power clients to participate in the avoidance of system clock
 * starvation situations, detection responsibility can be moved closer to the
 * hardware buffers and processors where starvation occurs, while leaving the
 * overall dynamic clocking policy to the RM. A typical client would be a module
 * that manages media processing and is able to determine when it is falling
 * behind by watching buffer levels or some other module-specific indicator. In
 * response to the starvation request the RM increases gradually the respective
 * clock frequency until the request vis cancelled by the client.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 * NvError Error;
 * 
 * // Request CPU clock frequency increase to avoid starvation
 * Error = NvRmPowerStarvationHint(
 *          RmHandle, NvRmDfsClockId_Cpu, ClientId, NV_TRUE);

 * // Cancel starvation request for CPU clock frequency
 * Error = NvRmPowerStarvationHint(
 *          RmHandle, NvRmDfsClockId_Cpu, ClientId, NV_FALSE);
 * 
 * @param hRmDeviceHandle The RM device handle.
 * @param ClockId The DFS ID of the clock targeted by this hint.
 * @param ClientId The client ID obtained during registration.
 * @param Starving The starvation indicator for the target module. If true,
 *  the client is requesting target frequency increase to avoid starvation
 *  If false, the indication is that the imminent starvation is no longer a
